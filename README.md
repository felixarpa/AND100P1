# Movie Admin

> This repository is a project for Interacció i Disseny d'Interficies (IDI), Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona (FIB), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)



### Introduction

The main idea was to create an Android app to add, delete, modify and search movies.
Each movie had **6 attributes**:
- String for the **Name**
- String for the **Country**
- Integer for the **Year**
- Integer from 0 to 10 for the **Rate**
- String for the **Director**
- String for the **Main character**

#### Name
The given name of the movie in English
#### Country
The country where the movie is produced
#### Year
The year it was released
#### Rate
Given by the App's user, the rate from 0 to 10, having ≥5 it *passes* and \<5 *fail*
#### Director
The name of the director or main director in case of having more than one
#### Main character
The name of the main character, if there is more than one main character the first one alphabetically 



### Changes

Since they (the professors) wanted a User Friendly App and an Efficient Interface, I modified the model of the project. First adding a new atribute to the movie:
- Data for the **Image**

then creating two new objects: Director and Character. Both with those paramethers:
- Data for the **Image**
- String for the **Name**

I could not imagine an App about Movies without any kind of image.
